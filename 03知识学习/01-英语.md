## 英译汉

Translate the following sentences into Chinese.

1. I found it fascinating (how naturally users developed emotional reactions to personal-assistant systems—and how frustrated they became when their machines failed to understand what they were trying to communicate.) I realized that the key to building machines that could understand human emotion were speech-recognition algorithms like those I had spent my 25-year career developing. (Para.5, L2-7)

我发现用户是如何自然地对个人助理系统产生情绪反应的，以及当他们的机器无法理解他们试图交流的内容时，他们会变得多么沮丧，这很有趣。我意识到，构建能够理解人类情感的机器的关键是语音识别算法，就像我花了 25 年的职业生涯开发的算法一样。

2. Building an empathy module is a matter of identifying those characteristics of human communication that machines can use to recognize emotion and then training algorithms to spot them. (Para.7, L4-7)

构建移情模块是识别机器可以使用特征识别情绪的人类交流特征，然后训练算法来识别这些特征。

3. We built the first-ever multilingual corpus of natural stress emotion in English, Mandarin and Cantonese by asking students 12 increasingly stressful questions. By the time we had collected about 10 hours of data, our algorithms could recognize stress accurately 70 percent of the time-remarkably similar to human listeners. (Para.9, L4-8)

我们建立了第一个英语、普通话和广东话的自然压力情绪多语言语料库。当我们收集了大约 10 个小时的数据时，我们的算法可以在 70%的时间内准确识别压力——这与人类听众非常相似。

4. We electronically extracted some 1,000 fundamental signal attributes from each song—acoustic parameters such as energy, fundamental frequency, harmonics, and so on—and then used the labeled music to train 14 different software “classifiers”, each one responsible for determining whether a piece of music belongs to a specific mood. (Para.11, L1-4)

我们从每首歌中电子提取了大约 1000 个基本信号属性——声学参数，如能量、基频、谐波等——然后使用被标记的音乐来训练 14 个不同的软件“分类器”，每个分类器负责确定一首音乐是否属于特定的情绪。

Translate the following sentences into Chinese.

1. Neuroscientists are still grappling with whether addictions are like normal habits, only more so, although they certainly can be thought of as extreme examples at the other end of the continuum, so can certain neuropsychiatric conditions such as obsessive-compulsive disorder—in which thoughts or actions become all-consuming—and some forms of depression, in which negative thoughts may run in a continuous loop. (Para.5, L5-9)

尽管上瘾症可以被认为是位于习惯极端例子，神经科学家们仍在努力研究上瘾是否类似于正常习惯，只是表现更甚。如此，某些神经精神疾病如强迫症和某些形式的抑郁症也可以（被看做习惯的极端例子）。对强迫症患者而言，某些特定思想或行为消耗其全部精力；某些形式的抑郁症而言，消极思想可能在持续循环中运行。

2. Particularly important are “reward-prediction error signals”, which, after the fact, indicate the mind’s assessment of how accurate a prediction about a future reinforcement actually turned out to be. (Para.8, L4-6)

“奖励预测误差信号”尤其重要。行为事实发生后，这些信号表明大脑对未来强化预测的准确性的评估。

3. Somehow the brain computes these evaluations, which sculpt our expectations and add or subtract value from particular courses of action. By monitoring our actions internally and adding a positive or negative weight to them, the brain reinforces specific behaviors, shifting actions from deliberate to habitual—even when we know we should not gamble or overeat. (Para.8, L6-9)

大脑以某种方式计算这些评估，这些评估塑造了我们的期望，并从特定的行动过程中增加或减少评估值。通过监控我们的内部行为，并给它们增加正或负权重，大脑强化了特定的行为，将行为从刻意转变为习惯性——即使我们知道我们不应该赌博或暴饮暴食。

4. New evidence from experiments on rats, as well as on humans and monkeys, now points to multiple circuits that interconnect the neocortex—regarded as the crowning glory of our mammalian brain—and the striatum, at the center of the more primitive basal ganglia, which sits at the core of our brain. These circuits become more or less engaged as we act deliberately or habitually. (Para.11, L3-7)

对大鼠、人类和猴子实验研究所得的新证据现在指向连接新皮层和纹状体的多条回路。新大脑皮层被认为是哺乳动物大脑的最高荣耀；纹状体则位于更原始的基底神经节的中心，位于我们大脑的核心。

5. Researchers have also identified a “deliberation circuit”, which involves another part of the striatum and is active when choices are not made on autopilot and instead require some decision making. (Para.15)

研究人员还发现了一个“思维回路”，它涉及到纹状体的另一部分，当选择并非自动做出而需要一些决策时，它就会活跃起来。

6. We decided to test whether the infralimbic cortex has online control over whether a habit can be expressed by using a new technique called optogenetics. (Para.18, L1-2)

我们决定用一种叫做光遗传学的新技术来测试边缘下皮层是否对一种习惯的表现有控制力。

\*\*Translate the following sentences into Chinese.

1. Predicting what ubiquitous computing and sensor data will mean for daily life is as difficult as predicting 30 years ago how the Internet would change the world. (Para.5, L1-2)

预测普适计算和传感器数据对日常生活意味着什么，就像预测 30 年前互联网将如何改变世界一样困难。

2. Working with the game engine Unity 3D, we have developed an application called DoppelLab that takes streams of data collected by sensors placed throughout an environment and renders the information in graphic form, overlaying it on an architectural computer-aided design (CAD) model of the building. (Para.7, L4-7)

通过与游戏引擎 Unity 3D 合作，我们开发了一个名为 DoppelLab 的应用程序，该应用程序获取由放置在整个环境中的传感器收集的数据流，并以图形形式呈现信息，将其覆盖在建筑的计算机辅助设计（CAD）模型上。

3. You will be able to soar above the bog and hear everything happening at once, listen closely to a small region, or swim underwater and hear sound collected by hydrophones. Virtual wind driven by real-time data collected from the site will blow through the digital trees. (Para.14, L6-8)

你将能够在沼泽地上空翱翔，同时听到一切发生的声音，近距离聆听一个小区域的声音，或者在水下游泳，听到水听器收集的声音。由现场收集的实时数据驱动的虚拟风将吹过数字树。

4. Recent work suggests that neuroplasticity—the ability of our brain to physically adapt to new stimuli—may enable perceptual-level cognition of “extra sensory” stimuli delivered through our existing sensory channels. Yet there is still a huge gap between sensor network data and human sensory experience. (Para.17, L1-4)

译文 1：最近的研究表明，神经可塑性—我们大脑在身体上适应新刺激的能力—可能使我们能够对通过现有感觉通道传递的“超感官”刺激进行感知水平的认知。然而，传感器网络数据与人类感官体验之间仍然存在巨大差距。

译文 2：最近的研究表明，神经可塑性——我们大脑在身体上适应新刺激的能力——能够对现有感官通道所传递的“超感官”刺激建立感知层面的认知。然而，传感器网络数据与人类感官体验之间仍然存在巨大差距。

5. Our first experiment will determine whether a wearable device in the field can pick out which of a set of audio sources a user is listening to. We would like to use this information to enable the wearer of a device to tune into the live microphones and hydrophones at Tidmarsh in much the same way that they would tune into different natural sources of sounds. (Para.19, L1-4)

我们的第一个实验将确定现场的可穿戴设备是否能够挑选出用户正在收听的一组音频源中的哪一个。我们希望利用这些信息，使设备的佩戴者能够接收到 Tidmarsh 的现场麦克风和水听器，就像他们接收不同的自然声音源一样。\*\*

We all begin this process when we are very young. Yet it comes with a trade-off that can work against us. The more routine a behavior becomes, the less we areaware of it. Witness computer gaming, Internet gambling, and constant texting andtweeting-and of course alcohol and drug use. A repetitive, addiction-driven patternof behavior can take over part of what had been deliberate choice. Neuroscientistsare still grappling with whether addictions are like normal habits, only more so.although they certainly can be thought of as extreme examples at the other end of thecontinuum,so can certain neuropsychiatric conditions such as obsessive-compulsivedisorder--in which thoughts or actions become all-consuming--and some forms ofdepression, in which negative thoughts may run in a continuous loop. And extremeforms of habit may be involved in autism and schizophrenia, in which repetitive.overly focused behaviors are a problem.

我们都在很小的时候就开始了这个过程。然而，它也伴随着一种可能对我们不利的交易。一种行为变得越常规，我们就越没有意识到它。见证电脑游戏，网络赌博，和不断的短信和推特-当然还有酗酒和吸毒一个重复的，上瘾驱动的行为模式可以接管一部分原本是深思熟虑的选择。神经科学家们仍在努力研究上瘾是否和正常习惯一样，甚至更像尽管它们确实可以被认为是连续统的另一端的极端例子，某些神经精神疾病也会如此，比如强迫症一一在这种情况下，思想或行为会占据一切一一以及某些形式的抑郁症，在这种情况下，消极的想法可能会不断循环。极端形式的习惯可能与自闭症和精神分裂症有关，在这些患者中，重复的、过分专注的行为是一个问题。

Signals discovered in the brain seem to correspond to this reinforcement-relatedlearning, as shown in studies originally conducted by Wolfram Schultz and RanulfoRomo, both then at the University of Fribourg in Switzerland, and today modeledby computational scientists. Particularly important are “reward-prediction errorsignals”, which, after the fact, indicate the mind's assessment of how accurate aprediction about a future reinforcement actually turned out to be. Somehow the braincomputes these evaluations, which sculpt our expectations and add or subtract valuefrom particular courses of action. By monitoring our actions internally and adding apositive or negative weight to them, the brain reinforces specific behaviors, shiftingactions from deliberate to habitual--even when we know we should not gamble orovereat

在大脑中发现的信号似乎对应于这种与强化有关的学习，正如最初由瑞士弗里堡大学的 Wolfram Schultz 和 Ranulfo Romo 进行的研究所示，今天由计算科学家模拟。特别重要的是“奖励预测误差信号”，它在事后表明大脑对未来强化预测的准确性的评估。不知何故，大脑计算出这些评估，塑造我们的期望，并从特定的行动过程中增加或减少价值通过监督我们的内部行为，并给它们增加积极或消极的重量，大脑强化了特定的行为，将行为从故意转移到习惯性--即使我们知道我们不应该赌博或吃得过多。

By using variations of this basic test, researchers, including Bernard Balleine of the University of Sydney and Simon Kill cross of the University of New South Walesin Australia, have found clues suggesting that different brain circuits take the lead as deliberate actions become habitual. New evidence from experiments on rats, as well as on humans and monkeys, now points to multiple circuits that interconnect the neocortex--regarded as the crowning glory of our mammalian brain--and the striatum, at the center of the more primitive basal ganglia, which sits at the core of our brain. These circuits become more or less engaged as we act deliberately or habitually.
通过使用这个基本测试的变体，包括悉尼大学的 Bernard Balleine 和澳大利亚新南威尔士大学的 Simon Kill cross 在内的研究人员发现了一些线索，表明当故意行为成为习惯时，不同的大脑回路起主导作用。在老鼠、人类和猴子身上进行的实验得到的新证据表明，有多个回路将新皮质(被认为是我们哺乳动物大脑的最高荣誉) 和纹状体(位于更原始的基底神经节的中心，位于我们大脑的核心)相互连接起来。当我们有意识地或习惯性地行动时，这些回路或多或少地参与其中。

We decided to test whether the infralimbic cortex has online control overwhether a habit can be expressed by using a new technique called optogenetics. Withthis technique, we could place light-sensitive molecules in a tiny region of the brain,and then, by shining light on the region, we could turn the neurons in that region onor off. We experimented with turning off the infralimbic cortex in rats that had fullyacquired the maze habit and had formed the chunking pattern. When we turned offthe neocortex just for a few seconds while the rats were running, we totally blockedthe habit.
我们决定用一种叫做光遗传学的新技术来测试下边缘皮层是否能在线控制一个习惯是否能被表达出来。用这种技术，我们可以将光敏分子放置在大脑的一个微小区域，然后，通过照射该区域的光线，我们可以打开或关闭该区域的神经元。我们尝试关闭老鼠的下边缘皮层，这些老鼠已经完全养成了走迷宫的习惯，并形成了分块模式。当我们在老鼠奔跑的时候关闭大脑皮层几秒钟，我们就完全阻止了这个习惯
